# RNN Speech-to-Text Model 🎙️➡️📝
This project demonstrates how to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for converting audio into text. With this codebase, you can preprocess data, train a custom model, and evaluate its performance. It is designed for flexibility and simplicity, making it easy for developers to build their own speech-to-text models.

# 🚀 Features
Custom Training

Train the model on your own dataset with minimal setup.

End-to-End Workflow

Includes audio preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Configurable Parameters

Modify model architecture, learning rate, and training configurations to suit your requirements.

Reusable Code

Modular design ensures easy integration into other projects.

Documentation

Comprehensive guides and comments for understanding and extending the code.
# 🛠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Librosa (for audio preprocessing)

NumPy
